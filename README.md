# My Journey into Shaders

This project will consist of learning about shader programming. I will do my best to recreate each shader in 3 different game engines: Unity, Unreal & Godot. The resources that I'm going to follow are:

* [Ben Cloward's Shader Graph Basics YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL78XDi0TS4lEBWa2Hpzg2SRC5njCcKydl)

* [The Unity Shader Bible](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61969779-the-unity-shaders-bible) by Fabrizio Esp√≠ndola & Pablo Yeber

* [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo & Jen Lowe

* [Shaders section in Godot's documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/index.html)
